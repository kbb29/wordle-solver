# Wordle Reinforcement Learning

This is a training exercise I set myself to consolidate my RL knowledge after doing RL courses on Coursera.  I created a Naive model (which doesn't use RL) and I am trying to beat its performance by trying various RL methods.

## Naive Model

This is a simple model which doesn't learn.  It uses a given word for the first guess (eg. 'roate', 'oater', 'arose') and then it chooses a random word which matches all of the hints given.  It completes a wordle episode in an average of about 4.75 guesses.


## Q Learning Approach



## Policy Gradient Approach



## Actor-Critic Approach
